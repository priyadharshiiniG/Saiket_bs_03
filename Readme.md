Task 3 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Explanation

In this task, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to gain a better understanding of the dataset. The analysis focused on identifying trends, understanding the distribution of data, calculating summary statistics, and studying customer churn behavior. Visual analysis and statistical measures were used to extract meaningful insights from the data.

Objective

The main objective of this task is to explore the dataset and understand the patterns, trends, and distribution of numerical features. Another important goal is to analyze customer churn and observe differences between churn and non-churn customers.

Tools Used

Python was used for data analysis. Pandas was used for data manipulation and summary statistics, while Matplotlib and Seaborn were used to create visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and churn-related graphs.

Understanding Trends and Distribution

To understand how the data is distributed, histograms were used to visualize the spread and frequency of numerical values. Box plots were used to identify median values, overall trends, and potential outliers present in the dataset.

Summary Statistics

Key statistical measures such as mean, median, and mode were calculated to understand the central tendency of numerical features. These statistics provide insights into the average behavior and common values in the dataset.

Churn Analysis

Customer churn was analyzed by comparing churned and non-churned customers. Visualizations were used to observe churn distribution and identify patterns related to numerical features, helping to understand factors that may influence customer churn.

Conclusion

Exploratory Data Analysis helped in understanding the overall structure and behavior of the dataset. The insights obtained from trends, distributions, summary statistics, and churn analysis provide a strong foundation for further data analysis and modeling.
